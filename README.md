  or unused files.
- Rebuild your files to match the database into folders or archives
  (zip, uncompressed 7z, torrentzip or torrent7z).
- Save time by scanning multiple databases in a single operation.
- Cache the directory contents of your external drives as offline storage.
  - Explore your drives without needing to connect them.
